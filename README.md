# Mars-Exploration

The colonization of Mars has finally started. In order to avoid wasting billions of dollars worth of equipment in space, a lot of 
simulation exercises need to be done here on Earth. To fully dial in the Mars rovers software, sample maps are needed to calibrate
its functions. This is a Java application that can generate randomized maps of Mars, based on some input criteria. These
requirements can change quickly, so this software is written in a way that it can handle changes in a **flexible** way.
